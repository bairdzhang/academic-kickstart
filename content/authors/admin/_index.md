I am a software engineer in [Waymo](https://waymo.com). Before that, I obtained Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [Johns Hopkins University](https://jhu.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Alan Yuille](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/), as a member of [Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning](http://ccvl.jhu.edu/). I obtained Bachelor of Engineering in the Computer Science Department at the [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/).
