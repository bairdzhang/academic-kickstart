I am a 4-th year Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science Department at the [Johns Hopkins University](https://jhu.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Alan Yuille](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/). Currently, I am a member of [Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning](http://ccvl.jhu.edu/). Before that, I obtained Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science Department at the [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/).
